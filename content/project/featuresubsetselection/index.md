title: Feature Subset Selection
summary: Research project on exploration of feature subset selection using genetic algorithms. Feature subset selection is a NP hard problem and involves selecting of subset of features to increase accuracy and reduce dimensionality. Proposed a wrapper based solution using Vortex Search Algorithm which is a meta-heuristic inspired from vortex pattern created by the vertical flow of the stirred fluids.
